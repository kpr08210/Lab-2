	<h2>Snow</h2>
	<p id="text">Recently, the Vermont Tech campus has accumulated a lot of snow.<br>
	This has caused a lot of the students at the college to have wet shoes and slip around.<br>
	Although many of people enjoy the snow, there are other people that would like the weather to go back to 50+ degrees. :)<br>
	Christmas has passed, and I am ready for the snow to dissapear. </p>
